## My Ikigai

At the core of my work lies my ikigai — a Japanese concept meaning "a reason for being." My passion is creating and building things from scratch, watching my code come alive in interactive, functional applications. I’m skilled in both front-end and back-end technologies, which allows me to contribute meaningfully to projects that make a real difference in people’s lives. In a world that increasingly needs robust, secure, and user-friendly applications, I find fulfillment in creating digital solutions that solve real-world problems and improve the user experience.

## Field of Expertise

I specialize in full-stack web application development. This field combines front-end and back-end technologies to create high-performance, interactive applications. My work spans various areas, from front-end design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to back-end development with Node.js, PHP, and database integration. Additionally, I focus on web application security, UI/UX design, DevOps practices, and API development — all aimed at building scalable, robust applications.

Keywords: Web development, full-stack, front-end, back-end, interactive applications, security, user experience, robustness, problem-solving, scalability.

## A Little About Me

I’m passionate about blending creativity with technology to develop applications that have real, practical impact. Building projects from the ground up allows me to align my technical skills with my desire to create solutions that matter. Full-stack development fulfills my ikigai by merging my love for building interactive, secure applications with the opportunity to solve meaningful challenges and improve users' lives.

## How I Built This Website

This website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fast and flexible static site generator. I chose the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme for its clean, minimalist design that emphasizes readability and simplicity.

To streamline the deployment process, I set up a GitHub workflow that automatically builds and deploys the site whenever changes are pushed to the repository. This continuous deployment setup ensures that updates are live almost instantly, providing a seamless experience for both the developer and the users.

Here’s a brief overview of the tools and technologies used:

-   **Hugo**: Static site generator
-   **Paper Theme**: Clean and minimalist design
-   **GitHub Actions**: Automates the build and deployment process

By leveraging these tools, I can focus on creating content and improving the site without worrying about the deployment details.
