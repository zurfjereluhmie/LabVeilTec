### Why Contract Testing is Important

Contract testing is a simple way to ensure that your services communicate correctly with each other. By defining and testing the contracts between services, you can catch integration issues early and avoid costly bugs in production. This approach is especially useful in microservices architectures, where services are often developed and deployed independently.

### When will I need this

I will need this when I start working on a new project that involves multiple services communicating with each other. By implementing contract testing early in the development process, I can ensure that my services are compatible and that any changes to one service do not break the contract with another.
