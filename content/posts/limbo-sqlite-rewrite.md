> TL;DR :
>
> Limbo is a modern, Rust-based rewrite of SQLite, bringing memory safety, async I/O, and WASM support to developers. It’s faster, safer, and ready for the cloud and browser.

## A Rust-Powered Rewrite of SQLite

SQLite, the popular embedded database, is getting a fresh new take: Limbo—a complete rewrite in Rust. This ambitious project, led by the Turso team, brings SQLite’s simplicity and performance into the modern era with memory safety, asynchronous I/O, and WebAssembly (WASM) support.

### Why Use Limbo ?

**Memory Safety**: Written in Rust, Limbo eliminates common bugs caused by unsafe memory operations, ensuring higher reliability.

**Asynchronous I/O**: Unlike SQLite’s synchronous nature, Limbo supports native async I/O, making it ideal for cloud applications, large queries, and scalable APIs.

**Built for WASM**: Designed with WebAssembly in mind, Limbo works seamlessly in browser environments and edge computing platforms.

### When will I need this

**Local-First Applications**: Offline-ready web and desktop tools.

**Serverless & Edge Computing**: Lightweight databases running closer to users.

**Cloud Integration**: Efficiently handle large-scale queries over APIs.

**Browser Tools**: Run a robust database directly in the browser with WASM.

**However**, Limbo is still in early stages of development, therefore it is not recommended for production use yet. However, it’s a promising project that could revolutionize how we use SQLite in modern applications.
