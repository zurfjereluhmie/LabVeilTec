## Staying updated in web development

To stay on top of the fast-evolving world of web development, I rely on a structured watch system that helps me capture, organize, and store relevant information. I use two main tools to gather insights and resources, which I then organize and process through a system that enables easy access to valuable content later.

## Information captation points

I primarily use two platforms to gather information:

-   **[Feedly](https://feedly.com/)** – This is my go-to source for aggregating RSS feeds. I subscribe to industry-leading blogs and thought leaders here, allowing me to receive content directly from trusted sources as soon as it's published.

-   **[Daily.dev](https://app.daily.dev/)** – A social platform for developers, Daily.dev helps me stay informed through a community-driven feed. I follow relevant tags, which filter content based on my specific interests within web development.

### Feedly subscriptions

In Feedly, I follow both blogs and influential figures in the web development industry. Here’s a breakdown of the content I access:

#### Blogs:

-   CSS-Tricks: A comprehensive resource for front-end development and CSS techniques.
-   Smashing Magazine: Covering design and coding practices, UX, and performance tips.
-   FullStack Bulletin: Focused on all aspects of full-stack development.
-   MDN Blog: Essential updates from Mozilla, particularly regarding web standards and browser developments.
-   Toptal Engineering Blog: In-depth engineering articles spanning both software and infrastructure topics.
-   UX Collective: Provides deep dives into UX and user-centered design principles.
-   ...and more.

#### Thought leaders:

-   Adrian Roselli: Known for his expertise in accessibility and web standards.
-   Ahmad Shadeed: A design engineer specializing in CSS and front-end development.
-   Max Böck: A front-end developer who shares insights on web development and design.
-   Gergely Orosz: A software engineers who shares insights from his experience at major tech firms like Uber and Microsoft.
-   ...and more.

These subscriptions ensure a steady flow of up-to-date articles, trends, and expert advice across the web development spectrum.

### Daily.dev tag system

On Daily.dev, I use a tag-based system to curate the type of information I receive, following topics like:

-   `#full-stack`: For holistic insights into end-to-end application development.
-   `#frontend`: Covering the latest in front-end frameworks, tools, and best practices.
-   `#backend`: Articles and discussions around server-side technologies and databases.
-   `#UX`: For enhancing the user experience through design and interaction principles.
-   `#a11y`: Focused on accessibility, ensuring inclusivity in my projects.

These tags help me stay current with developer insights, tutorials, and discussions on the precise areas I focus on in my work.

## Processing and storing information

When I come across a valuable article or insight, I save it to [MyMind](https://mymind.com/). This tool automatically tags the content and adds it to my “Read Later” collection, making it easy to categorize and locate information when needed. After reviewing the items in MyMind, I can organize them into specific collections for reference.

What sets MyMind apart is its AI-driven search engine, which helps me quickly find relevant content based on keywords, tags, or topics. This feature is invaluable when I need to recall specific details or refresh my memory on a particular subject.

## Why this system works for me

This watch system provides a structured yet flexible way to remain informed and inspired without feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information in web development. With a clear path from captation (Feedly and Daily.dev) to organization (MyMind), I can focus on the resources that are most relevant to my work as a developer, ensuring I’m always learning and adapting.
