## Framework independent data visualization

### Why to use Unovis

[Unovis](https://unovis.dev/) is a modular data visualization library that supports multiple frameworks. It offers a wide range of customizable charts, maps, and network graphs, with features that enhance performance and reduce bundle size. Unovis is designed to be easy to use and flexible, allowing developers to create data visualizations with minimal effort.

It's a great compromise between performance and ease of use. Compared to [D3.js](https://d3js.org/), Unovis is more lightweight and easier to learn, making it a great choice for developers who are new to data visualization or who need to create visualizations quickly.

### When will I need this

I will need this module when I need to create data visualizations in my web applications. Unovis is a great choice to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations quickly and efficiently. It's easy to use, flexible, and supports multiple frameworks, making it a great choice for a wide range of projects.

**However**, this library is still in the early stages of development (`v1.4` at the time of writing), so it might be premature to use it in production. I will keep an eye on it and only rely on it when it is more mature.
